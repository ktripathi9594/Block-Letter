# Block Letters ASCII Art

This project is a simple Python program that displays the initials of your name in block characters using ASCII art. ASCII art is a way of creating images using characters from the keyboard.

## Project Description

The program outputs the initials of your name in a 7x5 block letter format. Each letter is formed using the letter itself, creating a visual representation of your initials.

## How to Use

1. Open the `initials.py` file.
2. Modify the `initials` variable to include your initials in block letters.
3. Run the program to see your initials displayed in ASCII art.

## Example
